# JaPWppPoster
This bot was made to post links of whatsapp groups on JaP (Jovenes a Programar, programming course in Uruguay) discord guild whenever someone asks


Be careful, this bot was made to be a selfbot, using this as one can result in a ban of the account this bot was used on.
To use it with a bot account you must replace "bot.run(config.BOTTOKEN, bot=False)" with "bot.run(config.BOTTOKEN)"

This was made under like 10 minutes, so dont expect state of the art python masterclass, I just uploaded this to save my little projects, if you see this maybe you can give it some use
